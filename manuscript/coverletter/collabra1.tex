          \opening{Dear Dr. van Ravenzwaaij,} 
          This submission contains the manuscript ``Estimating the replicability of psychology experiments after an initial failure to replicate'' which we are submitting to Collabra: Psychology for publication as an original research report.
          
          The manuscript reports on 17 re-replications of psychology experiments for which an original replication had failed.  The original failures to replicate come from Boyce et al. 2023 (\url{https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.231240}), and the current work is a follow-up to that study.  
          
          As a practical matter, scientists in disciplines with low replicability rates (like psychology) will often face the question of what to do after a failed replication attempt. When does it make sense to try again and when does it make sense to move on? There is a very limited literature on how successful re-replications that attempt to ``rescue'' a failed replication are -- we are only aware of Many Labs 5 (Ebersole et al. 2020) which re-replicated 11 experiments from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (Open Science Consortium, 2015) in high-resource settings with expert input. 
          
          We build on this by looking at the rate of re-replication when both the first replication and re-replication are from early career researchers. Our current study provides an estimate of how often one can successfully ``rescue'' an effect after a failed replication by addressing possible causes of the first replication's failure. In 5/17 of these ``rescue'' projects (29\%), the ``rescue'' study mostly or fully replicated the original results, albeit with a smaller effect size; in the other 12, the second replication also failed.
          
          We speculate that successful rescue projects were due to larger sample sizes or methodological changes such as attention checks. and we discuss some of the individual projects as case studies.
